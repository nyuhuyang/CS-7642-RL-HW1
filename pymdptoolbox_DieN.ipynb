    "The game DieN is played in the following way.\n",
    "Consider a die with N sides (where N is an integer greater than 1) and a nonempty set B of integers. The rules of the game are:\n",
    "1. You start with 0 dollars.\n",
    "2. Roll an N-sided die with a different number from 1 to N printed on each side.\n",
    "a. If you roll a number not in B, you receive that many dollars. (eg. if you roll the number 2 and 2 is not in B, then you receive 2 dollars.)\n",
    "b. If you roll a number in B, then you lose all of your obtained money and the game ends.\n",
    "3. After you roll the die (and don’t roll a number in B), you have the option to quit the game.If you quit, you keep all the money you’ve earned to that point. If you continue to roll, go back to step 2.\n",
